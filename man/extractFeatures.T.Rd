\title{Extracting the lists of features of interest}
\description{
The function returns the list of features in common using the hmax rule (Frequentist model).
}
\usage{
extractFeatures.T(output.ratio, feat.names)
}
\arguments{
  \item{output.ratio}{ \code{The output object from the Frequentist model (ratio function)} }
  \item{feat.names}{ \code{names of the features (e.g Affy ID for genes)} }
}
\details{
To select a list of interesting features from the frequentist model we suggest a decision rules in the paper: the maximum of T(h)=nb genes in common/nb genes in common under the hypothesis of independence. It is pointing out the strongest deviation from independence.
}
\value{
The function returns an object of the class list. Each element is a matrix where the first column contains the name of the features while the other columns contain the p-values* from the experiments. It also saves a .csv file with the same information.

*instead of the p-values any other measure used to rank the features in the experiments can be used.
  \item{max }{The list of features in common selected on the basis of the threshold associated to T(hmax)}
